After
24-win
season,
Mavs
coach
careful
not
to
promise
too
much
for
next
season's
basketball
team.
Our
fans
deserve
better
than
this
said
Mavs
president
Donnie
Nelson.
The
regular
season
for
basketball
ended
this
week,
but
playoffs
are
extending
the
season.
Just
not
for
the
Dallas
Mavericks
Basketball
team.
