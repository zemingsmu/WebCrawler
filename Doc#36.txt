the
Dallas
Cowboys
overhauled
their
group
of
assistant
coaches
this
off-season.
Richards
is
proud
to
join
the
Dallas
Cowboys
football
organization.
He
is
credited
with
developed
the
famed
legion
of
boom
secondary
and
hopes
to
make
a
similar
impact
with
the
Cowboy's
secondary.
The
transition
should
be
fairly
seamless.
The
Cowboys
and
the
Seahawks
have
similar
principles
when
it
comes
to
playing
defense.
It
just
take
a
good
football
team,
made
of
up
of
good
players.
