The
Texas
Rangers
have
to
be
at
their
most
presentable
with
Cole
Hamels
pitching
and,
if
Thursday
is
the
best
version
of
themselves,
the
first
half
of
the
season
will
be
a
stroll
down
Kick
Me
In
the
Face
Lane
every
night.
At
this
juncture,
I'm
trying
not
to
think
about
the
second
half
of
the
season.
That's
10
months
away.
Hamels,
the
unquestioned
ace
of
what
is
a
suspect,
at
best,
Rangers'
pitching
staff
is
due
a
total
of
$42.5
million
in
'18
and
'19,
and
if
he's
not
good
....
Shelve
the
fear
of
a
mediocre
Hamels
for
a
second
and
just
go
with
his
Opening
Day
performance
on
a
beautiful
afternoon
at
the
Ballpark:
The
first
batter
hit
a
home
run,
the
second
smacked
a
double,
and
by
the
time
Hamels
was
done
he
had
allowed
three
runs
in
5
2/3
innings.
