Terence
Mann:
Ray,
people
will
come
Ray.
They'll
come
to
Iowa
for
reasons
they
can't
even
fathom.
They'll
turn
up
your
driveway
not
knowing
for
sure
why
they're
doing
it.
They'll
arrive
at
your
door
as
innocent
as
children,
longing
for
the
past.
Of
course,
we
won't
mind
if
you
look
around,
you'll
say.
It's
only
$20
per
person.
They'll
pass
over
the
money
without
even
thinking
about
it:
for
it
is
money
they
have
and
peace
they
lack.
And
they'll
walk
out
to
the
bleachers;
sit
in
shirtsleeves
on
a
perfect
afternoon.
They'll
find
they
have
reserved
seats
somewhere
along
one
of
the
baselines,
where
they
sat
when
they
were
children
and
cheered
their
heroes.
And
they'll
watch
the
game
and
it'll
be
as
if
they
dipped
themselves
in
magic
waters.
The
memories
will
be
so
thick
they'll
have
to
brush
them
away
from
their
faces.
People
will
come
Ray.
The
one
constant
through
all
the
years,
Ray,
has
been
baseball.
America
has
rolled
by
like
an
army
of
steamrollers.
It
has
been
erased
like
a
blackboard,
rebuilt
and
erased
again.
But
baseball
has
marked
the
time.
This
field,
this
game:
it's
a
part
of
our
past,
Ray.
It
reminds
of
us
of
all
that
once
was
good
and
it
could
be
again.
Oh...
people
will
come
Ray.
People
will
most
definitely
come.
