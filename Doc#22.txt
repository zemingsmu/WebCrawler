Under
normal
circumstances,
the
news
that
Dirk
Nowitzki
is
done
for
the
year
would
be
devastating.
But
Thursday's
announcement
was
met
with
a
shrug
because
his
season
ended
last
October
on
opening
night,
in
a
home
loss
to
the
horrendous
Atlanta
Hawks.
Dirk
had
surgery
on
his
left
ankle
and
will
miss
the
final
three
games
of
the
season
for
the
Dallas
Mavericks.
While
he
has
repeatedly
said
he
will
return
for
a
21st
NBA
season
in
the
fall,
he
is
also
justifiably
not
happy
about
how
this
is
all
ending
for
his
Hall
of
Fame
career.
All
he
wants
to
do
is
play
meaningful
games
and
contend
for
the
playoffs.
For
the
foreseeable
future,
the
only
thing
meaningful
his
team
is
contending
for
is
the
first
pick
in
the
NBA
draft.
The
problem,
of
course,
is
that
we
all
want
whatever
Dirk
wants,
but
the
franchise
can't
truly
move
forward
as
long
as
he
is
on
the
team.
