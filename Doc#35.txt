Dallas
cowboys
vice
president
Stephen
Jones
commented
on
the
release
of
receiver
Dez
Bryant
for
the
first
time
Tuesday.
Jones
said
moving
on
from
the
team's
all-time
leader
in
touchdown
receptions
was
in
the
best
interest
of
Bryant
and
the
Dallas
Cowboys
Football
team.
It
think
it's
always
difficult
because
Dez
was
an
amazing
player
for
us.
he
helped
us
win
a
lot
of
football
games.
At
the
same
time,
these
happen
in
our
business.
Jones
acknowledged
that
the
Cowboys
offense
and
passing
game
will
be
different
with
a
receiver
such
as
Bryant.
The
goal
is
to
create
the
best
football
team
and
win
a
championship.
