Mockingbird
part
5
Atticus
does
not
want
Jem
and
Scout
to
be
present
at
Tom
Robinson's
trial.
No
seat
is
available
on
the
main
floor,
so
by
invitation
of
Rev.
Sykes,
Jem,
Scout,
and
Dill
watch
from
the
colored
balcony.
Atticus
establishes
that
the
accusers
Mayella
and
her
father,
Bob
Ewell,
the
town
drunk
are
lying.
It
also
becomes
clear
that
the
friendless
Mayella
made
sexual
advances
toward
Tom,
and
that
her
father
caught
her
and
beat
her.
Despite
significant
evidence
of
Tom's
innocence,
the
jury
convicts
him.
Jem's
faith
in
justice
becomes
badly
shaken,
as
is
Atticus',
when
the
hapless
Tom
is
shot
and
killed
while
trying
to
escape
from
prison.
Despite
Tom's
conviction,
Bob
Ewell
is
humiliated
by
the
events
of
the
trial,
Atticus
explaining
that
he
"destroyed
[Ewell's]
last
shred
of
credibility
at
that
trial."[11]
Ewell
vows
revenge,
spitting
in
Atticus'
face,
trying
to
break
into
the
judge's
house,
and
menacing
Tom
Robinson's
widow.
Finally,
he
attacks
the
defenseless
Jem
and
Scout
while
they
walk
home
on
a
dark
night
after
the
school
Halloween
pageant.
One
of
Jem's
arms
is
broken
in
the
struggle,
but
amid
the
confusion
someone
comes
to
the
children's
rescue.
The
mysterious
man
carries
Jem
home,
where
Scout
realizes
that
he
is
Boo
Radley.
Sheriff
Tate
arrives
and
discovers
that
Bob
Ewell
has
died
during
the
fight.
The
sheriff
argues
with
Atticus
about
the
prudence
and
ethics
of
charging
Jem
(whom
Atticus
believes
to
be
responsible)
or
Boo
(whom
Tate
believes
to
be
responsible).
Atticus
eventually
accepts
the
sheriff's
story
that
Ewell
simply
fell
on
his
own
knife.
Boo
asks
Scout
to
walk
him
home,
and
after
she
says
goodbye
to
him
at
his
front
door
he
disappears
again.
While
standing
on
the
Radley
porch,
Scout
imagines
life
from
Boo's
perspective,
and
regrets
that
they
had
never
repaid
him
for
the
gifts
he
had
given
them.
