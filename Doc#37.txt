part

To
Kill
a
Mockingbird
is
primarily
a
novel
about
growing
up
under
extraordinary
circumstances
in
the
1930s
in
the
Southern
United
States.
The
story
covers
a
span
of
three
years,
during
which
the
main
characters
undergo
significant
changes.
Scout
Finch
lives
with
her
brother
Jem
and
their
father
Atticus
in
the
fictitious
town
of
Maycomb,
Alabama.
Maycomb
is
a
small,
close-knit
town,
and
every
family
has
its
social
station
depending
on
where
they
live,
who
their
parents
are,
and
how
long
their
ancestors
have
lived
in
Maycomb.
A
widower,
Atticus
raises
his
children
by
himself,
with
the
help
of
kindly
neighbors
and
a
black
housekeeper
named
Calpurnia.
Scout
and
Jem
almost
instinctively
understand
the
complexities
and
machinations
of
their
neighborhood
and
town.
