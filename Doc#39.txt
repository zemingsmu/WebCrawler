Mockingbird
part
3
Suddenly,
Scout
and
Jem
have
to
tolerate
a
barrage
of
racial
slurs
and
insults
because
of
Atticus'
role
in
the
trial.
During
this
time,
Scout
has
a
very
difficult
time
restraining
from
physically
fighting
with
other
children,
a
tendency
that
gets
her
in
trouble
with
her
Aunt
Alexandra
and
Uncle
Jack.
Even
Jem,
the
older
and
more
levelheaded
of
the
two,
loses
his
temper
a
time
or
two.
After
responding
to
a
neighbor's
(Mrs.
Dubose)
verbal
attack
by
destroying
her
plants,
Jem
is
sentenced
to
read
to
her
every
day
after
school
for
one
month.
Ultimately,
Scout
and
Jem
learn
a
powerful
lesson
about
bravery
from
this
woman.
As
the
trial
draws
nearer,
Aunt
Alexandra
comes
to
live
with
them
under
the
guise
of
providing
a
feminine
influence
for
Scout.
