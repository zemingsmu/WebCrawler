For
the
first
time
since
Dez
Bryant
was
released
last
Friday,
Cowboy
head
coach
Jason
Garrett
and
team
captions
spoke
publicly
about
the
move.
A
lot
of
different
factors
into
these
kinds
of
decisions.
The
guidepost
for
all
of
this
is
what's
in
the
best
interest
of
the
Dallas
Cowboys
football
team.
That's
why
we
made
this
decision.
We
wish
Dez
nothing
but
the
best
forward.
He
loves
football
and
is
a
great
player.
