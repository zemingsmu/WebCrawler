Basketball
is
a
limited-contact
sport
played
on
a
rectangular
court.
While
most
often
played
as
a
team
sport
with
five
players
on
each
side,
three-on-three,
two-on-two,
and
one-on-one
competitions
are
also
common.
The
objective
is
to
shoot
a
basketball
(approximately
9.4
inches
(24
cm)
in
diameter)
through
a
hoop
18
inches
in
diameter
and
10
feet
(3.048
m)
high
that
is
mounted
to
a
backboard
at
each
end
of
the
court.
The
game
was
invented
in
1891
by
Dr.
James
Naismith.
A
team
can
score
a
field
goal
by
shooting
the
ball
through
the
basket
being
defended
by
the
opposition
team
during
regular
play.
A
field
goal
scores
three
points
for
the
shooting
team
if
the
player
shoots
from
behind
the
three-point
line,
and
two
points
if
shot
from
in
front
of
the
line.
A
team
can
also
score
via
free
throws,
which
are
worth
one
point,
after
the
other
team
is
assessed
with
certain
fouls.
The
team
with
the
most
points
at
the
end
of
the
game
wins,
but
additional
time
(overtime)
is
mandated
when
the
score
is
tied
at
the
end
of
regulation.
The
ball
can
be
advanced
on
the
court
by
passing
it
to
a
teammate,
or
by
bouncing
it
while
walking
or
running
(dribbling).
