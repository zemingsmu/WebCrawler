Now
that
everyone
has
had
a
long
weekend
to
reflect
on
the
split
between
the
cowboy
and
Dez
Bryant,
let's
address
a
few
themes.
Bryant
was
still
clearly
the
Dallas
Cowboys'
Football
team
best
receiver
at
the
time
of
his
departure.
Bryant
is
one
of
the
best
receivers
in
Cowboys
history.
He
was
genuinelely
liked
by
his
teammates
and
regarded
as
a
warrior.
That
doesn't
make
him
a
leader.
It
if
did,
his
fellow
football
players
on
the
team
would
have
voted
him
to
a
captain
position.
