It's
Opening
Day,
and
for
one
day
our
team
is
going
to
win
the
whole
bleeping
thing.
It's
Opening
Day,
and
for
one
day
I
am
the
President
of
the
Texas
Rangers'
Optimist's
Club.
It's
Opening
Day,
and
for
one
glorious
day
the
Rangers
are
not
only
going
to
take
back
the
American
League
West
with
a
92-win
season,
they
are
going
to
register
that
strike
that
eluded
them
in
Game
6
and
relocate
the
World
Series
trophy
from
Houston
to
Arlington.
It
starts
Thursday
with
a
four-game
sweep
of
the
defending
World
Series
champion
Astros.
On
Wednesday,
Houston
Astros
owner
Jim
Crane
told
KRIV
of
Houston,
"We
had
a
few
problems
with
Texas
last
year,
not
wanting
to
switch
games
with
us.
There's
plenty
incentive
to
want
to
try
to
beat
up
on
Texas,
that's
for
sure."
