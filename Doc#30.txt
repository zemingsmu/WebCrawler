The
oddsmakers
at
BetDSI
Sportsbook
have
Ohtani
fever
as
much
as
all
those
baseball
scouts
and
writers
tripping
over
themselves
as
they
try
to
make
amends
for
casting
doubt
on
the
japanese
star
after
his
putrid
spring
training.
BetSDI
is
listing
Shohei
Ohtani
as
the
favorite
to
wring
the
american
League
MVP,
No.
1
even
over
his
Los
angeles
Angels
teammate
trout
and
reigning
MVP
Jose
Altuve
of
the
Houston
Astros.
Isn't
Baseball
fun?
