Kelly
Kraft
got
a
birdie,
just
not
the
one
he
wanted.
Kraft's
ball
hit
a
bird
in
flight
and
the
ball
dropped
into
the
water
in
front
the
green.
Kraft
made
a
double
bogey
and
finished
at
1
over
par
on
Harbour
Town
Golf
Links,
missing
the
cut
by
a
stroke.
Kraft's
group
asked
for
a
ruling,
figuring
the
player
would
simplly
retee
without
penalty.
Instead,
because
the
bird
is
not
a
made-made
object,
Kraft
had
to
play
it
as
a
ball
in
the
water.
