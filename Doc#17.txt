The
champagne
pop
echoes
you
hear
are
from
CBS
and
PGA
Tour
officials
celebrating
because
not
only
is
it
Masters
Week,
but
their
cash
cow
is
back
at
the
same
time.
Tiger
Woods,
you
have
been
sorely
missed.
It's
telling
that
since
Tiger's
personal
life,
body
and
game
all
went
into
the
rough,
the
rise
of
golf's
"young
stars"
have
not
come
close
to
making
the
sport
relevant
like
he
can.
Not
a
Rory.
Not
a
Justin.
Not
a
Dustin.
Phil
Mickelson
actually
enjoyed
a
wonderful,
winning
career.
And
he's
not
Tiger.
God
knows
we
media
scum
have
tried
to
find,
and
or
create,
Tiger's
equal.
Tiger
last
won
a
major
in
2008,
and
after
such
a
long
stretch
away,
the
42-year-old
is
at
last
playing
competitive
golf,
and
in
doing
so
is
here
to
save
the
game.
