UTA
fired
a
good
man,
and
now
they
are
looking
for
the
Ark
of
the
Covenant
without
Indiana
Jones
they
need
a
coach
who
can
win
in
the
Sun
Belt.
Then
he
has
to
win
the
conference
tournament
title,
because
the
Sun
Belt
will
never
receive
an
at-large
bid
to
the
NCAA
Tournament.
Then
he
must
generate
enough
interest
on
a
mostly
commuter
campus
in
a
large,
metropolitan
region
where
the
preferred
sports
are
pro,
and
in
particular
football.
At
UTA's
College
Park
Center
you
can
sit
just
about
anywhere
you
want
to
for
a
Mavericks
home
basketball
game.
TCU
is
in
the
Big
12
and
had
a
top
10
football
team
in
2017.
It
had
no
sellouts.
In
men's
basketball,
it
had
an
NCAA
Tourney
team
this
season,
and
routinely
there
were
empties
(not
a
lot)
in
the
6,800
Schollmaier
Arena.
Shortly
after
he
and
his
staff
were
fired
on
Monday,
Cross
issued
a
heartfelt
and
kind
statement
on
social
media.
UTA
makes
sweeping
changes,
fires
basketball
coach
Scott
Cross,
assistants
UTA
won
20
games
in
each
of
the
past
three
seasons,
and
people
didn't
show.
