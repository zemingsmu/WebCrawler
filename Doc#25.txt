The
golden
state
warriors
basketball
team
had
something
to
prove
all
right.
They
plan
to
stay
in
the
playoffs
this
year.
Thompson
found
his
shooting
touch
and
scored
27
points,
making
11
of
13
shots
while
7
footer
JaVale
McGee
contributed
15
points,
4
rebounds
and
2
blocked
shots
in
16
minutes.
Golden
state
came
with
the
kind
of
swarming
defense
it
is
so
used
to
playing
in
it's
basketball
games,
but
hadn't
exhibited
much
lately
as
rotations
were
mixed
and
matched
because
of
injuries
and
illness.
