Mockingbird
part
4
The
story
takes
place
during
three
years
(1933-35)
of
the
Great
Depression
in
the
fictional
"tired
old
town"
of
Maycomb,
Alabama,
the
seat
of
Maycomb
County.
It
focuses
on
six-year-old
Jean
Louise
Finch
(Scout),
who
lives
with
her
older
brother,
Jem,
and
their
widowed
father,
Atticus,
a
middle-aged
lawyer.
Jem
and
Scout
befriend
a
boy
named
Dill,
who
visits
Maycomb
to
stay
with
his
aunt
each
summer.
The
three
children
are
terrified
of,
and
fascinated
by,
their
neighbor,
the
reclusive
Arthur
"Boo"
Radley.
The
adults
of
Maycomb
are
hesitant
to
talk
about
Boo,
and,
for
many
years
few
have
seen
him.
The
children
feed
one
another's
imagination
with
rumors
about
his
appearance
and
reasons
for
remaining
hidden,
and
they
fantasize
about
how
to
get
him
out
of
his
house.
After
two
summers
of
friendship
with
Dill,
Scout
and
Jem
find
that
someone
leaves
them
small
gifts
in
a
tree
outside
the
Radley
place.
Several
times
the
mysterious
Boo
makes
gestures
of
affection
to
the
children,
but,
to
their
disappointment,
he
never
appears
in
person.
Judge
Taylor
appoints
Atticus
to
defend
Tom
Robinson,
a
black
man
who
has
been
accused
of
raping
a
young
white
woman,
Mayella
Ewell.
Although
many
of
Maycomb's
citizens
disapprove,
Atticus
agrees
to
defend
Tom
to
the
best
of
his
ability.
Other
children
taunt
Jem
and
Scout
for
Atticus's
actions,
calling
him
a
"nigger-lover".
Scout
is
tempted
to
stand
up
for
her
father's
honor
by
fighting,
even
though
he
has
told
her
not
to.
Atticus
faces
a
group
of
men
intent
on
lynching
Tom.
This
danger
is
averted
when
Scout,
Jem,
and
Dill
shame
the
mob
into
dispersing
by
forcing
them
to
view
the
situation
from
Atticus'
and
Tom's
points
of
view.
