Mockingbird
part
2
The
only
neighbor
who
puzzles
them
is
the
mysterious
Arthur
Radley,
nicknamed
Boo,
who
never
comes
outside.
When
Dill,
another
neighbor's
nephew,
starts
spending
summers
in
Maycomb,
the
three
children
begin
an
obsessive
and
sometimes
perilous
quest
to
lure
Boo
outside.
Scout
is
a
tomboy
who
prefers
the
company
of
boys
and
generally
solves
her
differences
with
her
fists.
She
tries
to
make
sense
of
a
world
that
demands
that
she
act
like
a
lady,
a
brother
who
criticizes
her
for
acting
like
a
girl,
and
a
father
who
accepts
her
just
as
she
is.
Scout
hates
school,
gaining
her
most
valuable
education
on
her
own
street
and
from
her
father.
Not
quite
midway
through
the
story,
Scout
and
Jem
discover
that
their
father
is
going
to
represent
a
black
man
named
Tom
Robinson,
who
is
accused
of
raping
and
beating
a
white
woman.
