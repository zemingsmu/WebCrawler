Dez
is
a
dominant
football
player,
and
he's
going
to
continue
to
be
a
dominant
football
player.
It's
tought
to
see
Dez
go
because
of
the
type
of
player
he
was.
He's
one
of
the
best
players
I
ever
played.
He's
a
guy
that
I
fed
off
his
passion.
Garrett
continued
to
stress
how
much
he
loves
the
former
Cowboys
wide
receive
and
hopes
they
can
have
a
lifelong
relationship.
